{"name":"Redmon","body":"# Redmon\r\n\r\n** Work in progress in the very early stages of dev **\r\n\r\nSimple sinatra based dashbord for redis.  After seeing the [fnordmetric](https://github.com/paulasmuth/fnordmetric)\r\nproject I was inspired to write this.  Some of the ideas there have be carried over here.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWatch your redis server live.\r\n\r\n![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27525257/dash-new.png)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nInteract with redis using a familiar cli interface.\r\n\r\n![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27525257/cli.png)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nDynamically update your server configuration.\r\n\r\n![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27525257/configuration-new.png)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIntuitively introspect registered keys.  ** Coming Soon **\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nNote:  Current version of Redmon is dependent on [Highcharts JS v2.1.9](http://www.highcharts.com/) which is not included with this repo and requires a license.  This will be replaced with something open source friendly in the future.  In the meantime you can download highcharts and put the highcharts.js file in public/vendor to get things working.  Do it!\r\n\r\nCurrently not a registered gem, but soon.  For now clone the repo and start the app as demonstrated below\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ bundle install\r\n$ bundle exec bin/redmon -h\r\nUsage: bin/redmon (options)\r\n    -a, --address ADDRESS            The thin bind address for the app (default: 0.0.0.0)\r\n    -n, --namespace NAMESPACE        The root Redis namespace (default: redmon)\r\n    -i, --interval SECS              Poll interval in secs for the worker (default: 10)\r\n    -p, --port PORT                  The thin bind port for the app (default: 4567)\r\n    -r, --redis URL                  The Redis url for monitor (default: redis://127.0.0.1:6379)\r\n        --no-app                     Do not run the web app to present stats\r\n        --no-worker                  Do not run a worker to collect the stats\r\n$ bundle exec bin/redmon\r\n>> Thin web server (v1.3.1 codename Triple Espresso)\r\n>> Maximum connections set to 1024\r\n>> Listening on 0.0.0.0:4567, CTRL+C to stop\r\n[12-03-10 15:49:40] listening on http#0.0.0.0:4567\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to simulate a weak load on redis\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ruby load_sim.rb\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen your browser to 0.0.0.0:4567\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Sean McDaniel\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to use, copy and modify copies of the Software, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
